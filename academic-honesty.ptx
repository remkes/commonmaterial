    <title>General University Policy</title>
    <p>
      The rules of academic honesty for students are defined by
      university policy, described in the Calendar and summarized in
      all course syllabuses. The material here does not override or
      change anything in those policies. As students, you must be
      familiar with the expectations for academic honesty. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This document is specific to mathematics courses. It gives you
      some specific guidelines for mathematic work, assignments and
      exams. It tells you the specific expectation that I have for my
      students.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main point of this document is that mathematics is not
      fundamentally different from English or psychology in its
      expectations of academic honesty: you still have to produce your
      own work and credit your sources. This sometimes comes as a
      shock, since many students seem to expect that mathematics
      is very different. It isn't. The same principles
      apply. This document gives some specifics of how to apply those
      principles.

    <title>Math Assignments</title>
    <p>
      The principle here is simple. When you had in an assignment, it
      must be your own work: your own thoughts, your own sentences,
      your own calculations. This is the point of an assignment. We
      don't set assignment because we need to mark something; we
      set assignments to encourage you to do the active work of
      solving mathematical problems. We want each of you to actually
      struggle though your assignments, since that's where some of the
      most important learning happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      That said, working in groups on assignments is excellent and
      highly encouraged. Mathematics works very well in groups, where
      you can remind each other of ideas, correct each other's
      mistakes, and help each through conceptual barriers. Groups are
      great. However, at the end of your group work, you still have to
      produce your own assignment. You should never be copying,
      word-for-word or calculation-for-calculation, another student's
      assignment. Please work together: talk through the questions,
      check each other's work for errors, all these things. But please
      produce your own work at the end. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I have produced a list that summarizes the specifics of my
      assignment expectations for academic honesty. (This list repeats
      some of the expectations in <xref
      ref="chapter-how-to-write-an-assignment" />, but elaborates more
      on the academic honesty pieces.)
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Obviously, you can't just copy another student's assignment.
        That's cheating, regardless of whether you had permission to
        copy. Given that you are reading this, I'm assuming
        that you are, in fact, trying to do your work honestly. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work with a group, you still need to write your own
        assignments. Often your calculations will be nearly identical
        to your group, and that's to be expected (though you should
        always do your own calculation and understand them, not just
        copy someone else's calculation). Your sentences that
        surround your calcualtions, however, should not be the same
        sentences as any other student's. Write up your own work, use
        your own words to explain calculations and answer conceptual
        questions. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you work with students in the class, note the names of the
        students you worked with at the end of your assignments. This
        is quite simple: just write, "On this assignments, I worked
        with NAME, NAME and NAME". This is appreciated since it gives
        credit for the help your received from your group. It also
        helps for marking; when assignments are very similar, if we
        can see that students worked together, that similarity is
        expected. (Identical assignments are still a problem, as
        discussed above). 
      </li>
      <li>
        It's fine if someone else (a friend, a family member, a tutor,
        etc) helps you with an assignment. However, it is not
        acceptable if they do the questions for you. They should help
        you figure out how do to the problem, often by working through
        the main concepts and similar examples problems, and then you
        should do the problems on your own and write up your solutions
        on your own.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you used another book (article, etc.), you must cite that
        book just as you would in an English course. You may use any
        citation style.
      </li>
      <li>
        I'll talk about the use of internet resources in the next
        section, since that topic deserves its own section. 
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="section-internet-resources">
    <title>Internet Resources</title>
    <p>
      I know that many of you will do the majority of your mathematic
      works with a browser open. That's fine, and the internet is full
      of some amazing resources. But you have to be clear and careful
      about how you use online resources. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First and foremost, you have to cite what you use. Any
        websites, videos, calculation tools that you use for your
        assignment should be cited at the end of the assignment. This
        is the expectation that I find is the most suprising to many
        students, but I'm serious. Internet resources are like any
        resources, and for academic writing, we cite our resources. We
        do this to give credit to all those people in the world who've
        written these resources, thus helping us do our academic work. 
      </li>
      <li>
        These citations should be specific as reasonable. Don't say
        that you used Youtube or even Khan Academy; tell me
        specifically which video you watched that helped you and give
        me the URL. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Online calculation tools (Wolfram Alpha, Demos, Symbolab, and
        many others) are great. Please use them to do calculations, to
        check your work. However, like all resources, you need to give
        credit. For calculation tools like these (and any other
        computer algebra systems), you can tell me at the start of the
        assignment that you used a calculation tool and then very
        briefly indicated the places that it was used in the
        assignment. If you simply double checked your work with any of
        these tools, just say so as part of your citations. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Most of the above discussion of citation has in mind static
        sources (online texts, encylopedias, video explanations). The
        internet also have interactive sources: various places where
        you can ask for math help and receive responses from people to
        your specific questions. Some of these are free and some of
        these are payed subscription sites. I want to be very clear
        about my expectation for these kind of sites.
      <blockquote>
        Please do ask general questions on a math forum or help site.
        Some like "I need help figuring out how to solve systems of
        equations" is very reasonable. If you want specific examples,
        use the activities in the course and ask people to help you
        understand the activities. However, please DO NOT post any
        assignment questions or take-home exam questions to any online
        math forum or help site. I need to draw a clear line here, so
        that it is easy for you to understand my expectations. Posting
        assignment questions or exam questions online is not
        acceptable. 
      </blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>
        Often when students look online for material from the course,
        they will find similar material which differs in notations,
        definitions, or solution methods. If you find another way of
        doing things or use an alternative notation from what we did
        in class, you need to explain to me what the alternative
        notation means and/or why the alternative method works. You
        can't assume that your reader (me or the marker) knows all the
        possible variation of notation (of which there are many). You
        have to be explicit about any new idea and how they relate to
        the course material. 
      </li>
      <li>
        As one final specific note, Wikipedia is not an authoratative
        source for quotationes. It is an immensely useful source and a
        great place to look for reminders and concepts. I frequently use it
        informally to help remember various pieces of mathematics. But
        you can't use it as an authority; you can't claim that
        any definition, notation or method is correct because you read
        if on Wikipedia. 
      </li>
    </ul>

    <title>Exams</title>
    <p>
      The term tests in this course are take-home exam, to be complete
      over two or three exams. These are very much like assignments,
      but they have different expectations. Unlike assignments, where
      working together and getting help are encouraged, I expect you
      to do the tests entirely on your own. Don't talk to your
      classmates or anyone else about the questions: do what you can
      with your own resources. 
    </p>
    <p>
      This is easy is you simply don't talk about the exam until you
      have submitted it. If you follow this clear instruction, you'll
      be perfect. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All the discussion about online sources still apply to the
      take-home tests. You are welcome to use static courses, such as
      videos and online text (with citations, of course), to help you
      with the concepts and ideas of the course which relate to the
      test. It is not at all acceptable to post test questions
      anywhere online.
